```terraform
resource "ably_namespace" "namespace0" {
  app_id            = ably_app.app0.id
  id                = "namespace"
  authenticated     = false
  persisted         = false
  persist_last      = false
  push_enabled      = false
  tls_only          = false
  expose_timeserial = false
}

resource "ably_namespace" "namespace_batching" {
  app_id            = ably_app.app0.id
  id                = "namespace"
  authenticated     = false
  persisted         = false
  persist_last      = false
  push_enabled      = false
  tls_only          = false
  expose_timeserial = false
  batching_enabled  = true

- `batching_interval` (Number) When configured, sets the maximium batching interval in the channel.
- `batching_policy` (String) When configured, sets the policy for message batching.
- `expose_timeserial` (Boolean) If true, messages received on a channel will contain a unique timeserial that can be referenced by later messages for use with message interactions.
- `persist_last` (Boolean) If true, the last message on each channel will persist for 365 days.
- `persisted` (Boolean) If true, messages will be stored for 24 hours.
