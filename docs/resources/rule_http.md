The `ably_rule_http` resource allows you to create and manage an Ably integration rule for HTTP. Read more at https://ably.com/docs/general/webhooks


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "ably_rule_http" "rule0" {
  app_id = ably_app.app0.id
  status = "enabled"
  source = {
    channel_filter = "^my-channel.*",
    type           = "channel.message"
  }
  target = {
    url = "https://example.com/webhooks"
    headers = [
      {
        name  = "User-Agent"
        value = "user-agent-string"
      },
      {
        name  = "headerName"
        value = "headerValue"
      }
    ]
    signing_key_id = ably_api_key.api_key_0.id
    enveloped      = true
    format         = "json"
  }
}

- `source` (Attributes) object (rule_source) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--source))
- `target` (Attributes) object (rule_source) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--target))

### Nested Schema for `target`

Required:
